# CMPUT174_WordPuzzle
This is the mini-project 1 of CMPUT 174, UAlberta, Fall 2020
Word Puzzle is a game where the player will try guessing a secret word, one letter at a time. The player has a limited number of guesses. Each time the player guesses a letter that is not part of the secret word or a letter that has already been correctly guessed, the player loses a guess; if the player guesses a letter that is part of the secret word and has not been guessed yet, all occurrences of this letter are displayed in the correct position of the secret word, and the player does not lose a guess. The game ends when the player either has guessed all letters in the word correctly (win) or runs out of guesses (lose).
